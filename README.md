### Course Description

Data Visualization is the graphical representation of information. Data
Visualization and related technologies create value within organizations
by providing insight from complex sets of data by communicating key
aspects therefrom. This course focuses on how to increase the likelihood
of action based on insights from data by telling stories with data that
leverage effective Data Visualizations. The course includes a mix of
theory and hands-on application using contemporary processes and Data
Visualization technologies.

### Learning Objectives

Upon successful completion of this course, students should be able to:

-   understand key concepts, processes and techniques for telling
    stories with data using effective visualizations
-   use contemporary tools to efficiently design and develop effective
    data visualizations
-   effectively present “stories with data” to different audiences

### Individual Assignments

For each assignment, students will use a business context and related
data to create a “story”. Students will be randomly assigned into groups
of five or six. Each student will be provided time to present their
visualization to their group. Each group will be required to fill out an
assessment sheet. The assessment sheet will be provided in class when
necessary.

### Individual Labs

The labs provide students the opportunity to learn the required data
visualization tools while applying concepts, processes and techniques
from the course. The dates of the labs are listed in the “Course
Schedule” section.

### Quizzes

There are three (3) quizzes. Each quiz will cover only new material
relative to the previous quiz or from the start of the course in the
case of the first quiz. Material for each quiz will be taken from the
lectures and assigned readings.

### Examinations

There is one (1) closed-book exam. An exam review will be provided the
week prior to the exam. Exam rescheduling requests will be considered
only in extraordinary circumstances.

### Late/Incorrect Submissions

Late submissions will have a 10% per day grade reduction.

### Development Environment

Students are required to set up their development as described in Lab 1.

### Disability Accommodation

The University of Utah seeks to provide equal access to its programs,
services and activities for people with disabilities. If you will need
accommodations in the class, reasonable prior notice needs to be given
to the Center for Disability Services, 162 Union Building, 581-5020
(V/TDD). CDS will work with you and the instructor to make arrangements
for accommodations.

### General Guidelines on Academic Misconduct

These guidelines are not comprehensive. Rather, they reflect the most
common misconceptions that students have with respect to academic
misconduct: Never share a file with another student. If two or more
students collaborate on an effort, the outputs should either be:
Allocated to a single student. All other students must reproduce the
outputs independently. Destroyed. All students must reproduce the
outputs independently. When helping another student, never show them
your solution. Consider, working on their computer/whiteboard/paper
instead. If the student copies your solution manually by examining your
solution, you will be equally responsible for the given academic
misconduct. If a submission is not indicated as “group-based”, assume
that you need to complete the submission independently. If
group/independent nature of a submission is unclear, check with the
instructor before making the assumption. A busy schedule is not a
rationale for submitting all/part of someone else’s work as your own. If
you are responsible for unethical behavior in an academic misconduct
case, be truthful and forthcoming with information for the instructor
and/or university administrators involved. The typical sanction for a
first-time academic misconduct case is a grade of -100% for the
submission item. In addition, your details will be entered into a
centralized database so administrators can manage repeat offenders.

### Statement of Professional and Ethical Conduct

Because of the importance of professional and ethical behavior in
business, and its emphasis in our program, professional or academic
misconduct is not tolerated in the David Eccles School of Business.
Students are expected to adhere to the standards of behavior outlined in
the University of Utah Code of Student Rights and Responsibilities
(Policy 6-400). Students engaging in behavioral misconduct could be
subject to suspension or dismissal from the University. Students
involved in any form of academic misconduct, including but not limited
to cheating on tests, plagiarism and collusion may, at the instructor’s
discretion, receive a failing grade in the course, examination, or
academic assignment. In addition to or instead of this sanction, the
instructor may refer the case to the Student Behavior Committee for
hearing. If the instructor chooses not to do so, the Associate Dean for
Academic Affairs, after appropriate investigation, may do so along with
a recommendation to dismiss the student from the Business School. If,
after hearing the evidence, the Committee determines that the student in
question is guilty of the misconduct charged, the Committee may impose
sanctions in addition to those taken by the professor. If the academic
dishonesty is not proven, the instructor must rescind any sanctions
imposed and will be required to evaluate the student’s performance with
the assumption that there has been no misconduct. The School will treat
the student likewise. If a student suspects another student of academic
misconduct, he/she should refer the incident to the instructor, the
appropriate department, the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs, or the
Student Behavior Committee, administered by the Associate Dean of
Students, 270 Union.

### Statement of Grading Policy

Grading provides feedback to students on how well they have mastered the
content and learning objectives of a particular course to allow students
to capitalize on strengths and work to improve weaknesses through future
courses of action. The DESB grading policy is intended to ensure grades
offer reliable feedback regarding student performance, and to ensure
fairness and consistency across the School. The faculty member is
responsible for arriving at a grade for each student that the faculty
member believes appropriately reflects the student’s mastery of the
course material and learning objectives. The faculty member will then
consider the class’ overall performance in terms of School guidelines.
These guidelines are provided to ensure that grading, on average for the
School as a whole, is sustained at a reasonable level over time. The
guidelines are as follows:

If students have a concern about their grade in a particular course,
they should consider whether it reflects an accurate evaluation of their
mastery of the course material and learning objectives, in terms of the
above descriptors. If they need clarification of the instructor’s
evaluation, they should meet with the instructor to obtain additional
information and feedback. If after doing so, they believe their grade
was arrived at in an inappropriate manner, they may pursue an appeal
through the School’s appeals process as described in Section 5.15 of the
University of Utah Code of Student Rights and Responsibilities (Policy
6-400). Use of Electronic Devices in Exams Use of any and all electronic
devices (e.g. pagers, cell phones, language translators, laptops,
tablets, calculators, etc.) is forbidden during an exam unless otherwise
specifically authorized by the instructor. A student who uses an
unauthorized device may be subject to penalties for academic misconduct.
